# Homework03-PWGen

## Description

This is a password generator using Javascript.  

Below are the steps I have taken to complete this project:

* I used arrays to fulfill acceptance criteria.  
* I used window.prompt() to request the number of characters        required, but used window.confirm() to ask whether to use lower case, upper case, numbers and/or special characters, to prevent the user from entering invalid data.  
* I also added code to prevent the user from typing an invalid password length.  
* I added comments to briefly explain how I implemented this password generator.  

Here's the link to my password generator:
